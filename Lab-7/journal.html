                <p>Last week, feeling frustrated from studies, I took a break and went hiking to Cold Spring. The
                    weather was perfect, with clear skies and a gentle breeze. The trail was challenging but rewarding,
                    offering stunning views of the Hudson River and the surrounding mountains. Along the way, I
                    encountered various wildlife, including deer and a variety of birds. It was a refreshing and
                    rejuvenating experience that helped me clear my mind and return to my studies with renewed energy.

                    Last year, I had the opportunity to visit Spiti Valley in Himachal Pradesh, India. The valley is a
                    cold desert mountain valley located high in the Himalayas and is one of the least populated regions
                    in
                    India. The landscape is stunning, with snow-capped mountains, crystal-clear rivers, and ancient
                    monasteries dotting the landscape. I spent my days exploring the region, visiting monasteries, and
                    trekking through the beautiful valleys. The people were warm and welcoming, and the culture was
                    fascinating. It was a truly unforgettable experience that I will cherish forever.
