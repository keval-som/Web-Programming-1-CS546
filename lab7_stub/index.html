                <h2>Cold Spring, NY</h2>
                <p>My favorite place to visit is Cold Spring, NY. It's a small town on the Hudson River, about an hour
                    north of New York City. The town is full of cute shops, great restaurants, and beautiful views of
                    the river and surrounding mountains. I love to spend the day walking around the town, browsing the
                    shops, and enjoying a meal at one of the local restaurants.
                </p>
