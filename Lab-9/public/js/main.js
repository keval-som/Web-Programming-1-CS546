UUsing JavaScript in your browser only, you will listen for the form's submit event; when the form is submitted, you will:

Get the value of the input text element (this will be the Fibonacci index) 
Calculate the Fibonacci value for the given index
Determine whether or not the number is a prime number
Add a list item to the #fibonacciResults list of numbers you have checked. This list item should have a class of is-prime if it is a prime number, or not-prime it is not.
If the user does not have a value for the input when they submit, you should not continue checking and instead should inform them of an error somehow.
